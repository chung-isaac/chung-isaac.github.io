						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Besides the 4 key main ideas, I learned things like how symmetry affects your perception of a collection of objects. It's interesting to see concepts from graphic design and art carry over, like visual hierarchy and the idea of leading lines. It's also a little shocking at how much things you think are random but subconsciously affect your user interaction flow on a website. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the clear formatting of explaining a Gestalt principle, and then immediately presenting how it can be applied to UI design. I also liked that the example of the pseudo-site continued to be used for all the concepts. We could basically see it change and notice the principles employed by the end of the article. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "User Interface Design isn’t all about pretty pixels and sparkly graphics. It’s mainly about communication, performance and convenience." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 8/10! A solid + comprehensive overview on a lot of Gestalt concepts. </p>
