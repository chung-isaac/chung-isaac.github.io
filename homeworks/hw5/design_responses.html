                        <li>
                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that there are definitely things I like AND dislike about decisions people make with
                                UI or animations. I love all of these but lowkey when I saw some I was like .. that's a little
                                over the top.. I think that I realized I like when things have smooth transitions and I kind of
                                dislike custom cursors / finger trackers. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> It's very enriching to see multiple perspectives on classic / repeated concepts like a sign-up
                                screen or a menu. I also think that it's kind of menacing that when you design UI, sometimes
                                you expect yourself to reinvent the wheel and do something that's never been made before, <source>
                                it's also reassuring to see that inspiration doesn't always have to end up in structural unlikeness.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> 1. The shopping app transitions were actually so fire. Very clean and I liked that it faded to white
                                for a split second and flooded back in smoothly. It kind of "cleanses" your attention palette and is
                                gentle on the eyes too.
                            
                                2. For sure the AI assistant one. The map animation was so elegant and also provided a clear demo on
                                what to expect / how to use the service.</p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8/10. It was actually extremeley helpful (and cool!) to see a lot of inspiration! I think the only thing
                                I wish they did was include a little explanation segment or a perspective from the author of each site. </p>
