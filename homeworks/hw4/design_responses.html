					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that there's an actual contrast minimum mandated by a large organization like W3C. It's
								reassuring to learn that there's a standardized system for measuring
								and implementing contrast requirements. I looked on the W3C site and saw more standards they put 
								in place as well! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked that they gave multiple perspectives / motivations for why you should make your websites 
								accessible! The quote about inaccessible web design being rude was perfect. They also gave more 
								prudential reasons, such as legal issues coming from inaccessible websites or the idea that it's
								harder to make a website accessible retroactively, rather than starting off the bat with accessibility 
								in mind. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Lastly, the most important aspect of creating an accessible color system is giving your team the ability to reference it when needed, so everyone is clear about proper usage. This not only reduces confusion and churn, but also ensures that accessibility is always a priority for your team. </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 9/10! It was informative and thought-provoking. Kind of shorter than I expected! </p>
