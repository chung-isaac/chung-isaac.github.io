					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There is a crazy amount of science in finding the "Goldilocks zone" for things like animation length and such. It's interesting because a lot of the times (maybe moreso in art) things like this are based on feeling / intuition rather than formulae, and it's really cool to see the potential explanations for why I liked / disliked animations from last homework's article. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> For sure the animations / visuals. I love things like data visualization and always appreciate when an animation is super clean (especially after animating css myself in this course..). They were extremely helpful for proving that these things do make a difference, especially with the side-by-side comparisons. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "But. Forget about these rules if you are creating a decorative animation on your website or trying to attract the userâ€™s attention to certain elements. In these cases, animation can be longer." I liked this quote because it's a reminder that after you learn why all these rules work, you can break them to specialize your site for your purpose! </p>
						</li>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 10/10. Prob best article I've read so far in the class! It was really lengthy but extraordinarily useful and the animations / visuals were so helpful. </p>
