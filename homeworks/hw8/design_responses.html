				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that people indeed misuse the psychology principles discussed in the last article to manipulate users! It was interesting to see those exact principles be applied in this insidious context and it helps explain a lot of the subconscious biases I felt when I interacted with dark pattern scams in the past. I think the list of 11 examples was helpful for always being on the lookout for a wide variety of dark patterns. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article was realizing how many layers of defense I've built up over the course of using technology. Like I am actually so glad the author talked about their experience with daFont because I remember the first time I used it, I was like "wow these ads are so predatory" because they would just be huge "Download Ready!!" buttons. A lot of the pop-up windows for updates and such are also things that I feel like my peers and I have adapted to (maybe after falling for it once or twice..). It's kind of disheartening but a little satisfying that we've grown to resist dark patterns without thinking.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "... when we think of “bad design”, we think of the creator being sloppy or lazy but without ill intent. Dark patterns, on the other hand, are not mistakes. They’re carefully crafted with a solid understanding of human psychology, and they do not have the user’s interest in mind." </p>
					</li>

				<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a
							five, please briefly explain why.</p>
						<p> 9/10. I think this was an excellent follow-up to the design article from Homework 9. </p>
