					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> The website I chose was Aristide Benoist's personal website! To see the page I did the wireframe for, go to the site and click on any of the images in the cool-looking carousel.</p>
							<a href="https://aristidebenoist.com">(click here!)</a>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/original wireframe.jpeg"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/redesigned wireframe.jpeg"/>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> This website is designed to showcase the creator's past work and projects. The site itself is most likely intended for 
								clients, because of the contact info, but also just as a personal website to display for others. The design accomplishes
								its purpose by having a user-controlled image carousel that opens into more showcases of individual projects. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> My redesign approached two problems I encountered: accessibility and a small QoL change. Since I couldn't
								think of much changes for the carousel (Hmm... I wonder why...), I decided to focus on making the buttons easier to find,
								along with implementing a scroll function for the right sidebar. As a user, I kind of got lost looking for the back button
								 / site button, so I made them bigger in the redesign. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
