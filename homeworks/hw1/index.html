    <ul>
        <li>1. I learned that every single detail of a (widely used) app interface has gone through countless iterations. 
            I didn't realize that even small things like the way a phrase is worded has been tested and iterated over many
             versions of the app to where it is now.
        </li>
        <li>2. Kind of a basic answer but I really liked the gifs deconstructing the apps. I liked that they put pauses
            between the animations so you would naturally try and predict what would come next.
        </li>
        <li>3. "Someone had to map out all of the content use cases and decide on the appropriate subheaders to pair with them."
            Kind of crazy to think that someone has sweated over the tiniest details that you don't even notice consciously
            on a site / app.

        <li>I'd rate this article an 8.</li>
