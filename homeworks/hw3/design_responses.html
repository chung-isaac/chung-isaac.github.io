					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned how type fonts can influence hierarchy, rather than just the font size. Having contrasting
								fonts, like serif and sans-serif, can help draw the user to the header, then the body, and etc. I also
								learned to complement the design of the website (e.g. if you have a cool image, have a simpler font) </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the idea about using special ratios as base guidelines, and then experimenting on top of them.
								The article was very consistent about supporting lots of experimentation, and that all the "rules" where
								essentially principles that you could play around with. Also lowkey making a styleguide looks so satisfying...</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "When choosing type, take into account your audience and their needs. Simply put, empathize with your users." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Feedback</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? If you scored below a five, please briefly explain why.</p>
							<p> 6 - at some point, there was too much information being presented, to the point where it felt unorganized. It was all good / education information though! </p>
